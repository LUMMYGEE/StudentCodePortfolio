# Student Coding Portfolio

# 💼 Billy Green - Web Developer Portfolio

I built this portfolio to showcase what my students will be able to create after just 8 weeks of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with me.

It’s designed to demonstrate the kind of real, professional-looking projects beginners can build — even with no prior experience — when they follow a structured, hands-on approach. From responsive layouts to interactive components and clean design, everything in this project reflects the practical skills students will gain in just two months of focused learning.
